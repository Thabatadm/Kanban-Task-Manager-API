# 📑 Kanban Task Manager API

A robust RESTful API for managing Kanban-style tasks. Built with **Spring Boot 21**, secured with **JWT**, and deployed on **Render**.  
It features a complete **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system and live API documentation.

---

# 🚀 Live Documentation (Swagger)

You can interact with the API and test all endpoints directly from your browser:

> ⚠️ Since this project is hosted on Render's free tier, the first request may take between **30–50 seconds** while the server wakes up.

# ⚖️ RBAC System

The application implements a strict Role-Based Access Control system to protect project integrity and collaboration workflows.

| Action | Owner | Developer |
|---|---|---|
| Create project | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage members | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create cards | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit / Move cards | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete cards | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete project | ✅ | ❌ |
| Leave project | ❌ (Protected) | ✅ |

---

# 🛡️ Security Architecture

## 🔹 URL-Level Security

Implemented using Spring Security:

- Automatic JWT validation
- Public endpoints under `/auth/**`
- Protected private routes

---

## 🔹 Service-Level Security

Additional business logic validations:

- Ownership verification
- Critical action restrictions
- Role validation before sensitive operations

# 🧪 How to Test the API

## 1️⃣ Register Users

### Create Owner Account

```http
POST /auth/register
```

```json
{
  "name": "Patricia",
  "lastName": "Gomez",
  "email": "patricia@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

---

### Create Developer Account

```http
POST /auth/register
```

```json
{
  "name": "Pedro",
  "lastName": "Martinez",
  "email": "pedro@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

> Use different emails to simulate team collaboration.

---

# 2️⃣ Authentication

## Login

```http
POST /auth/login
```

```json
{
  "email": "patricia@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Copy the JWT token from the response.

Then:

1. Click the **Authorize** 🔒 button in Swagger
2. Enter:

```txt
Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

---

# 3️⃣ Project Workflow

## Create Project

> The user who creates the project automatically becomes the **Owner**.

```http
POST /api/projects/create
```

```json
{
  "name": "Task Management System",
  "description": "Spring Boot backend project"
}
```

---

## Add Member to Project

```http
POST /api/projects/{projectId}/members
```

```json
{
  "userId": 2,
  "role": "DEVELOPER"
}
```

---

## Create Card

```http
POST /api/projects/{projectId}/cards/create
```

```json
{
  "title": "New Task",
  "description": "Task description",
  "status": "TO_DO",
  "priority": "MEDIUM"
}
```

---

# ✅ RBAC Verification

Switch authorization to the **Developer** token and try to:

- Delete a project
- Delete cards
- Manage project members

### Expected Response

```http
403 Forbidden
```
